Complete docker-compose stack for usenet services
========================================

Complete docker-compose stack usenet services.

Bundling the Dockerfiles for different services under a single repository sucks, as it complicates publishing images to the Docker Hub, but this seems to be the 'cleanest' way of organizing multiple services for docker-compose.

Instructions
------------
- Install docker-compose
- ```docker-compose up -d```
